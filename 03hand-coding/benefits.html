        <h1>What Are the Benefits of Music?</h1>
        <p>Music offers a wide range of benefits for both mental and physical well-being, including stress reduction,
            improved mood, and enhanced cognitive function. Engaging with music, whether by listening or playing, can
            have a profound positive impact on people of all ages.</p>
        <h2>Mental Health and Emotional Benefits</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Reduces stress and anxiety:</dt>
            <dd>Listening to music can lower blood pressure and decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Many
                older adults, for example, report that music provides them with stress relief and relaxation.</dd>
            <dt>Improves mood and boosts feelings of happiness:</dt>
            <dd>Music stimulates the brain to produce "feel-good" hormones like dopamine and endorphins. This can lead
                to feelings of joy, excitement, and overall satisfaction.</dd>
            <dt>Evokes and manages emotions:</dt>
            <dd>Music has a unique link to our emotions, helping to evoke or regulate feelings. It can assist with
                emotional expression and provide a sense of comfort or motivation.</dd>
            <dt>Helps fight depression:</dt>
            <dd>Studies have shown that music can help alleviate symptoms of depression.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Cognitive and Neurological Benefits</h2>

            <dt>Boosts cognitive performance:</dt>
            <dd>Music can improve focus and productivity, especially during work or study. Classical or ambient music,

            <dt>Slows cognitive decline:</dt>
            <dd>Actively engaging with music can help keep the aging brain engaged and has been associated with a lower
